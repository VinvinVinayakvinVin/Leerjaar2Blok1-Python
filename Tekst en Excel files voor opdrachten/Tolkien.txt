Faithless is he that says farewell when the road darkens.  The Fellowship of the Ring
I will not say, do not weep, for not all tears are an evil.  The Fellowship of the Ring
All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.  The Fellowship of the Ring
I warn you, if you bore me, I shall take my revenge.
If more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world.
Short cuts make long delays.
Its the job thats never started as takes longest to finish.
I will not walk backward in life.
Even the smallest person can change the course of the future.
Darkness must pass / A new day will come / And when the sun shines / It will shine out the clearer
Courage is found in unlikely places
